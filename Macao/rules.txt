
Special cards:
Ace(used to only change the suit)
Two(forces the player to pick up 2 cards)
Three(forces the player to pick up 3 cards)
Four(forces the player to skip a turn)
Seven(stops any special card)

While taking turns place a card down, it has to either match the suit or the value of the card down. If you have more than one hand of the same
value in hand you can place all of them down, if not only one move is allowed. After the move is finished the validate button must be pressed to 
end your turn, while waiting for the other player's move you can't click on anything.

Special cards can be put on top of anything.

The point of the game is to have no more cards in hand. Good luck!
